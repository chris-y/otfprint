otfprint parses an OTF file and prints out some given text as SVG paths.

How do I use it?
usage: otfprint <font> <text>
example: otfprint BPreplayBold.otf "TarrafaHC"

The result will print out to stdout, and includes two sections:
<defs>: defines the paths for each letter used in the text
<g>: a group containing your text, flipped up and anchored to the middle
     I suggest you include it into another group, so you can translate and
     scale the text as follows:
     <g transform="translate(225,500) scale(0.086)">
      <... output from otfprint ...>
     </g>

otfprint has no dependencies and does not depend on the system it is running
on.
The resulting SVG will always be exactly the same, and always be a direct
representation of the data in the OTF file (paths, character widths and kern).
No scaling or any other kind of transformation is done.

Why did I write this?
I tried using fontforge to export an OTF font to SVG and use that font inside
an SVG.
Then I found out SVG embedded fonts are hardly supported anywhere.
Then I tried importing the OTF font from the SVG, which also isn't very well
supported.
Then I tried using the SVG font as a basis to write SVG paths manually, but
the result was different from what inkscape and google chrome rendered.
Then I said "fuck this shit, I'll parse the OTF myself".
