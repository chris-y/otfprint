otfprint parses an OTF file and prints out some given text as SVG paths.

How do I use it?
usage: otfprint <font> <text>
example: otfprint BPreplayBold.otf "TarrafaHC"

The result will print out to stdout, and includes two sections:
<defs>: defines the paths for each letter used in the text
<g>: two groups containing your text. The inner group is flipped up and
     anchored to the middle. The outer group is moved down by the height
     of the font, and moved midway again, so the text appears directly
     in the output SVG file.
     You should translate and scale the outer group the way you see fit.

otfprint has no dependencies and does not depend on the system it is running
on.
The resulting SVG will always be exactly the same, and always be a direct
representation of the data in the OTF file (paths, character widths and kern).
No scaling or any other kind of transformation is done.

Why did I write this?
I tried using fontforge to export an OTF font to SVG and use that font inside
an SVG.
Then I found out SVG embedded fonts are hardly supported anywhere.
Then I tried importing the OTF font from the SVG, which also isn't very well
supported.
Then I tried using the SVG font as a basis to write SVG paths manually, but
the result was different from what inkscape and google chrome rendered.
Then I said "fuck this shit, I'll parse the OTF myself".
